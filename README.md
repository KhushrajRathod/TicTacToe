# Tic-Tac-Toe
Ever-evolving TicTacToe game in Next.js (at the moment)

## History
To get a hang of new frameworks and languages I learn, I re-write this. Here's a list of what this has been in:

| Order | Languages / Tools                  | Type | Source location |
|-------|------------------------------------|------|-----------------|
| 1     | Java                               | CLI  | Unavailable     |
| 2     | Python                             | CLI  | Unavailable     |
| 3     | C++                                | CLI  | Git history     |
| 4     | Vanilla JavaScript                 | GUI  | Git history     |
| 5     | ReactJS                            | GUI  | Git history     |
| 6     | Next.js                            | GUI  | Git history     |
| 7     | Next.js + TypeScript               | GUI  | Git history     |
